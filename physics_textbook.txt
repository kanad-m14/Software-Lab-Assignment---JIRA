            CHAPTER 1: MECHANICS AND MOTION
            
            Physics is the fundamental science that seeks to understand how the universe works. 
            Mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with motion and forces. In this chapter, 
            we will study the laws of motion and their applications. Newton's laws of motion form 
            the foundation of classical mechanics.
            
            Force is a vector quantity that causes acceleration in objects. Mass is a measure of 
            the amount of matter in an object. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. 
            Velocity is the rate of change of position. These concepts are interconnected through 
            mathematical relationships and equations.
            
            Energy and momentum are conserved quantities in physics. Kinetic energy is the energy 
            of motion, while potential energy is stored energy. Work is done when a force acts 
            through a distance. Power is the rate at which work is done or energy is transferred.
