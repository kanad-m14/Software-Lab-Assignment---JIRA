            CHAPTER 1: CELL BIOLOGY AND LIFE PROCESSES
            
            Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms. Cells are the basic 
            units of life and all living things are composed of cells. Cell biology examines 
            the structure and function of cells. There are two main types of cells: prokaryotic 
            cells and eukaryotic cells.
            
            DNA contains the genetic information that controls all cellular processes. Proteins 
            are essential molecules that perform most cellular functions. Enzymes are special 
            proteins that catalyze biochemical reactions. The cell membrane controls what enters 
            and exits the cell, maintaining cellular homeostasis.
            
            Cellular respiration is the process by which cells generate energy from nutrients. 
            Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical 
            energy. Reproduction allows organisms to produce offspring and continue their species. 
            Evolution explains how species change over time through natural selection.
