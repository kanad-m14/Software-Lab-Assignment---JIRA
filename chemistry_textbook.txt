            CHAPTER 1: ATOMIC STRUCTURE AND CHEMICAL BONDS
            
            Chemistry is the science that studies matter and its properties. Atoms are the basic 
            building blocks of all matter. The structure of atoms determines the chemical properties 
            of elements. Electrons, protons, and neutrons are the fundamental particles that make 
            up atoms. The arrangement of electrons in atoms determines how atoms bond with each other.
            
            Chemical bonds form when atoms share or transfer electrons. Ionic bonds form when 
            electrons are transferred from one atom to another. Covalent bonds form when atoms 
            share electrons. The type of bond formed depends on the electronegativity difference 
            between the atoms involved.
            
            Molecules are formed when atoms bond together. The properties of molecules depend on 
            the types of atoms present and how they are bonded. Chemical reactions involve the 
            breaking and forming of chemical bonds. Energy changes accompany all chemical reactions.
