            Mathematics is the foundation of science and engineering. In this chapter, we will explore 
            the fundamental concepts of calculus. Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with 
            continuous change. The two main branches of calculus are differential calculus and integral 
            calculus. Differential calculus focuses on rates of change and slopes of curves. Integral 
            calculus deals with accumulation of quantities and areas under curves.
            
            The concept of limits is fundamental to calculus. A limit describes the behavior of a 
            function as its input approaches a particular value. Functions and their properties are 
            essential in understanding calculus. We will study various types of functions including 
            polynomial functions, trigonometric functions, and exponential functions.
            
            Derivatives represent the rate of change of a function. The derivative of a function 
            measures how the function changes as its input changes. Integration is the reverse process 
            of differentiation. Through integration, we can find areas, volumes, and solve many 
            practical problems in physics and engineering.
